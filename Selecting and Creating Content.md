I am going to use a python script similar to that used in the article "[[Publish Parts Of Obsidian To My Personal Site]]" to select the notes for publishing and prepare them to be fed into a static site.

- [x] Modify script to select content for this project and dump it to a publishing directory
- [ ] Setup GitHub Actions to copy content to a new repo for publishing
