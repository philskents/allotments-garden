## TLDR
### New allotments
- Create a new empty git repository on your git server
- Add it as a submodule to your parent git repository
- Set the tracking branch for your submodule

### Exisitng directories
- Create a new empty git repository on your git server
- Clone it to a location outside your vault
- Copy the existing content from your vault into the new Allotment
- Push it to your git server
- Delete the original content from your vault
- Add the new Allotment as a submodule to your parent git repository
- Set the tracking branch for your submodule

## New Allotments
For new Allotments you start at your git server (GitHub for me) and create a new git repository. Add a single file so we have something to validate with (delete it after the setup is complete). Once that is created you can go ahead and add it to your main repository by running the following command in the root of your vault.

`git submodule add git@REMOTE_URL:/path/to/git/repos/allotment.git path/in/vault`

Because of the way obsidian-git handles submodules we also need to set the branch to track for the submodule (probably main).

`git submodule set-branch --branch <default-branch> -- <repo-name>`

And finally run this for reasons I do not understand

`git submodule update --init`

You can now go ahead and enjoy your new Allotment and all of its contents will be synchronized to your new repository for you to handle as you see fit!
