# Vault setup for Allotments
## TLDR
- You need a vault that uses obsidian-git for backup/sync
- Sort content for publishing into one or more folders
## Setup
Firstly you heed to have an Obsidian vault setup and configured to use [obsidian-git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) for backup and sync.

The core premise of Allotments is that, within your digital garden, any shared content exists within one or more specific folders. For example this particular body of work exists in my vault as ```VAULT_ROOT/ðŸ—‚ Projects/Digital Garden Publishing``` .
