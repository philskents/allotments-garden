# Introduction
## Summary
Take two... Obsidian git nowapparently supports git submodules and that is a game changer for this project. I am going to refer to this methodology as Allotments purely as a throwback to [this wonderful British tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotment_(gardening)) which was [solarpunk](https://builtin.com/greentech/solarpunk) before it was cool!

My new strategy is as follows:

- A single Obsidian vault backed up and synchronized using git will form the core of my Obsidian setup
- This will require some specific [[Vault Setup|vault configurations]] to support Allotments

~~## Summary
Design and build a method whereby I can publish multiple "digital gardens" to public hosting from a single Obsidian Vault.~~

~~## Minimum Viable Product~~
- [x] Notes be selectable based on one of the following criteria
	- [x] Path
	- [x] Tag
- [x] The subsequent subset of notes must be published to a static web host automatically at the end of the script
~~## Research
There are multiple different projects in existence for publishing Obsidian Vaults to the web, including Obsidians own offering [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). None of these met my need of publishing in a granular fashion however so I decided to create my own solution based on "[[Publish Parts Of Obsidian To My Personal Site]]".~~

~~## Proposed workflow~~
