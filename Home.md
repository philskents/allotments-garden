# Introduction
## Summary
Take two... Obsidian git now apparently supports git submodules and that is a game changer for this project. I am going to refer to this methodology as Allotments purely as a throwback to [this wonderful British tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotment_(gardening)) which was [solarpunk](https://builtin.com/greentech/solarpunk) before it was cool!

My new strategy is as follows:

- A single Obsidian vault backed up and synchronized using git will form the core of my Obsidian setup
- This will require some specific [[Vault Setup|vault configurations]] to support Allotments
